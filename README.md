# GamesJam2018
This was a project made in 48 hours, by our group members Kirill Melnikov, Matthew Ng, Vincent Yu, Matt Gould, Johnston Yang, Andy Wu, Andy Liu, and Johnny.
Unfortunately, we could not complete the project fully, which is why the first game does not work correctly. 
The loading screens are also of poor completely, due to being on a short schedule when combining all the scenes together.
Note:
- The game entails a story of a man struggling in life, of which the loading screens provide the background stories, and the actual gameplay entails the struggle of the individual.
- Ctrl + H skips the current game, so that you may continue to the next one!
